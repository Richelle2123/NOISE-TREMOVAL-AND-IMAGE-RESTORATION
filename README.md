# NOISE TREMOVAL AND IMAGE RESTORATION
This project focuses on the enhancement and restoration of noisy grayscale medical images, such as X-rays, using classical image processing techniques. The objective is to remove real-world noise (e.g., Gaussian, quantum or motion) without adding synthetic noise, thereby improving image clarity for better medical diagnosis. The denoising methods applied include Non-Local Means (NLM), BM3D, Wavelet Denoising, and Wiener Filtering. The project is implemented in Python using OpenCV, scikit-image, and BM3D libraries, and evaluated using visual comparison of original and denoised outputs.
